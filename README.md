At a very young age Joey learned every possible thing that could make them alive or every possible thing for them have everyday needs. He worked pretty in every single day, he put aside being a child , he suffer a lot of difficulties in life. All of that truly change him, his character, and personalities, he became more matured not because of his age but because of his situation. Joey focused on his study and at the same time on his side hustled. Because of being great, Joey achieves a lot of achievements, he became an honor student consecutively in high school. He also had things he likes because of the best of his ability that does not depend on his parents. That makes him more persistent and consistent with his dreams because he is always thirsty for success. When Joey finished studying in high school he decided not to pursue college, for the reason that he always thinks about their financial situation. But his mother  and his siblings never failed to support and encourage him to continue studying and pursue college and achieve the career he wants. At first,Joey suffers difficulty choosing a career, as time goes by Joey decided to take Criminology Entrance Examination in Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. and finally wants to pursue the path of becoming a future Law Enforcer.

He's a man who always wants new things every  single day of his life. He wants new sufferings, memories, achievements even small things that could make him feel alive. There's a lot of things he likes and he doesn't like. He likes to have fun with friends like adventures ,sports, and other recreational activities that could make him move,especially fishing at Bulusan Lake ,one of the best bonds they'd do with his father before. He also loves to cook which his mother taught him anything he wants to eat, he cooks it because for him any food that is hard and takes a long time to cook is delicious. His specialty recipes are Laing Adobo sa Gatang Native chicken,especially when it is (tinutungan) which could be done by burning the grated coconut to make the milk more flavorful. Also he loves engaging in Physical Activities, he loves getting into fit, getting sweat and making himself active. He is really great, huh? Doesn't he? So far I have told you those things about Joey.
